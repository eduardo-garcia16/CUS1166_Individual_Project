#CUS1166 Individual Project Submission by Eduardo Garcia

## Features Implemented
I was able to properly implement the database, blueprint, and overall basic foundational skeleton structure of the project.
It imitates the Example Use Case because of the requirement of making sure the new use case follows the same style.

- Implemented proper database
- Implemented proper blueprint
- Implemented models with correct field structure (i.e. DateTime field structure for 'Appointment Date' field)
- Ability to list and store appointments in database from proper form; However was unable to implement correctly on HTML page

## Notes for the professor
Due to my lack of HTML understanding, I took a lot of time attempting to use the proper bootstrap template and property. This took the majority of the time, however I believe I demonstrate a proper understanding of database integration and structure present in the code.
